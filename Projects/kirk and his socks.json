    "scenetext": "Admiral James T. Kirk looked around his quarters, frustrated. Where were those damn socks? He needed them if he wanted to go on a trip to Beta III. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find them anywhere! Was it Sabrina who took them again? That annoying cat always liked to play with his socks before bringing them back to him, ripped apart. Or was it that idiot Spock who \"borrowed\" them without asking? Whatever the case might be, Jim needed to find his missing socks ASAP or else he wouldn't be able to go on his much-needed vacation.\n\nWith a sigh and a muttered curse under his breath (he wasn't sure which one), Jim decided to expand his search. Maybe they got stuck in the transporter buffer or something like that. It happened before. So he left his quarters and started wandering through the corridors of the starship Enterprise, looking for his lost socks. And as he walked, he began to notice other things amiss. Things that didn't belong where they were found. Like a torn piece of uniform floating in space near a ventilation shaft or a discarded PADD lying abandoned on the floor. Someone must have been busy while he wasn't looking.\n\nHis eyebrows raised in surprise, but before he could investigate further, a familiar voice called out to him. \"Jim!\"\nHe turned towards the source of the call and saw his friend, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, waving at him from across the corridor. \"Scotty! What are you doing here?\" he asked, walking towards the Scottish engineer.\n\"I had some problems with the warp core, Captain,\" Scotty explained, his eyes darting nervously around them. \"It kept blowing up every time I tried to start it.\"\nJim frowned. \"That sounds serious, Scotty. You should have informed me about it sooner.\"\nThe engineer looked guilty. \"I know, I know. But I wanted to fix it myself first, you see... and then I got distracted by these lovely ladies from the planet Xandar...\" His voice trailed off and he blushed slightly.",

    "scenetext": "Jim snorted with laughter. \"Never mind that, Scotty. Did you happen to see my socks by any chance?\"\nScotty thought for a moment, then shook his head. \"No, I'm afraid not, Captain. But I can always make you a new pair if you want.\"\n\"That won't be necessary,\" said Jim, smiling. \"Thanks anyway, Scotty. Anyway, what do you mean by 'blowing up' the warp core?\"\n\"Oh, it wasn't anything major,\" said Scotty dismissively. \"Just a few minor explosions, nothing to worry about really.\"\n\"Minor explosions?\" repeated Jim incredulously. \"You know this is a spaceship, right? With people inside? Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?\"\nScotty looked affronted. \"Of course, I do! But sometimes these things just happen, you know. It's not always my fault.\"\n\"This time it definitely was your fault,\" said Jim sternly. \"But since we managed to catch you in the act and because I believe this was an honest mistake, I'll let it slide this time. But don't even think about doing something like that ever again, understand?\"\n\"Yes, Captain,\" said Scotty, looking chastised. \"I understand.\"\nThey stood there for a moment longer, then Jim clapped his friend on the shoulder. \"Alright, Scotty. You'd better get back to work now and finish whatever you were doing. And remember, no more exploding warp cores, okay?\"\n\"Yes, Captain,\" Scotty replied, still looking rather glum.\nJim watched him walk away, then continued his search for his socks. As he moved further and further from the engine room, he started seeing less and less signs of tampering with the ship's systems. Apparently, Scotty hadn't had time to vandalize the entire vessel. Good thing, too, Jim thought. He would have had to deal with a very unhappy chief engineer then.\nBut despite searching everywhere he could think of, Jim couldn't find his elusive socks. They simply refused to reveal themselves. ",

    "prompt": "Jim decides to visit the ship seer Minerva McGonagall, (maybe she can find his missing socks?)",
    "scenetext": "Feeling frustrated and a bit desperate, Jim decided to try another approach. He knew of someone who might be able to help him find his lost socks. Her name was Minerva McGonagall and she was the ship's resident seer. Whether her predictions came true or not, nobody really knew except perhaps herself, but everyone agreed she was quite good at it. Or maybe she was just lucky. Who knows.\n\nJim made his way to Minerva's quarters, located deep within the bowels of the ship. The door slid open at his touch and he stepped inside. The place looked more like a messy office than a living quarters; papers and books were scattered everywhere, covering every available surface including the floor. In the middle of all this chaos sat a small woman with wild hair and equally wild eyebrows. She looked up when the door opened and gave Jim a friendly smile.\n\n\"Hello, Admiral,\" she greeted him warmly. \"What brings you to my humble abode today?\"\n\"I need your help, Minerva,\" Jim said seriously. \"I've lost my socks and I can't go on my trip without them.\"\nMinerva tilted her head to the side, considering this. \"Lost your socks, you say? That must be quite unlucky.\"\n\"Why?\"\nShe shrugged. \"No reason. It's just an expression. So, do you want me to look for them?\"\n\"Please, Minerva. I need those socks!\"\nShe smiled and stood up, gesturing for him to follow. \"Very well, come with me then.\"\nTogether they left her quarters and began walking through the corridors, Minerva leading the way confidently, as if she knew every inch of the ship by heart. After several minutes they arrived at a small storage room filled with boxes, crates and all sorts of other stuff.\n\"In here,\" she announced, opening the door. \"Somehow I feel these are the premises where your missing socks might be hiding.\"\nJim looked inside doubtfully. It looked more like a junkyard than a place where anyone would hide their socks. But what did he know? Maybe there was some logic behind Minerva's actions that eluded him. He stepped into the room, trying to ignore the dust and the general smell of neglect, and started looking around.\nFor several minutes neither of them found anything. \n\nThen suddenly Jim saw something that caught his eye. A small piece of fabric sticking out from under one of the boxes. He bent down and pulled it out. It was a sock! His sock!\n\"Eureka!\" he exclaimed triumphantly, waving the recovered garment in the air. \"I found it! Now I can go on my vacation.\"\nHe turned towards Minerva, intending to thank her for her help, but stopped short when he noticed she wasn't looking at him. Instead, her eyes were fixed on something behind his back. Frowning, Jim slowly turned around... and froze in shock. ",
